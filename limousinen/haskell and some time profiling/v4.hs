-- Okay. Listen.
-- ```
-- toInt :: String -> Int
-- toInt = read
-- ```
-- IS FUCKING SLOW. LIKE REALLY FUCKING SLOW. FUCKING FUCK SLOW. YES, THAT SLOW.
-- (Or did I just do something really wrong in my `toInt`, huh?)
--
-- So for you to even be able to solve this problem you need a faster toInt functions.
-- That's right.
-- You need to reimplent a faster standard function, and it needs to be faster.
--
-- GLHF.
--
--
-- Well... Turns out it is possible to make a faster toInt.
-- WTF HASKELL?
--
-- (but well, maybe it's because my toInt don't give a fuck about negative numbers.)
-- (but actually I implented that too and it was faster, so yeah)
-- WTF HASKELL??
--
-- Anyway.
-- This shit works. 
-- I went from 77.4% (!!!) CPU time in native `toInt` to 18.7% with my own `toInt`.
